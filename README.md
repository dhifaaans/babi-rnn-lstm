# RNN-LSTM with Facebook bAbI Tasks

The code found here contains an RNN and an LSTM implemented both in Keras.

Performance is comparable to that of the Facebook baseline LSTM results.

## Getting started

This project utilizes the following additional libraries and you may need
to install them on your machine before running the project.

- keras: https://keras.io/
- pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/

It's advisable to have the anaconda environment on your machine.

To run the project simply open up your terminal and run your environment.

After activating the environment run the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal
if you wish to see the project in jupyter.
